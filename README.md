# OVERVIEW

This project showcases a comprehensive Power BI dashboard developed for **LearnSphere**, an online learning platform. 

I led the end-to-end design of a reporting solution that delivers actionable insights across **student lifecycle analytics**, **course performance**, **instructor productivity**, and **institutional financials**.

The goal was to simulate a real-world business case, where decision-makers at an edtech firm need data-driven intelligence to improve academic outcomes, optimize instructor allocation, and ensure sustainable revenue flow.


## Project Objectives

The project was built to address the following business objectives

- What are the **enrollment trends** across months and departments
- What are the students that are *active*,*dropped* or *graduated* and whats their academic performance
- Which **instructors** are driving student success and how do their ratings compare?
- Which courses are *in-demand* and how does course difficulty impact performance?
- How much revenue is being generated? and what are the trends in **pending payments** and **scholarship distribution**
